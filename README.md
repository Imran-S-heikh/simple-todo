## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript
- [React Beautiful DND](https://github.com/hello-pangea/dnd) - For Drag and Drop Functionality
- [Next PWA](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ducanh2912/next-pwa) - For Nextjs PWA support 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- Recoiljs - For State Management


### What I learned

Although this was a straightforward project, it took more time than I initially expected. I focused on making the UI/UX as smooth as possible, which added to the development time. A couple of challenges also contributed to the delay. Specifically, React Beautiful DND and next-pwa don't support the latest versions of React or Next.js, and they arenâ€™t actively maintained. These issues caused the app to crash, so I had to find alternative solutions.

Despite these challenges, integrating PWA support was a rewarding experience. It adds a layer of functionality to the project, allowing me to use the todo app even when offline. While I was familiar with the concept of PWAs, this was my first time setting one up in a project. Overall, it turned out to be a fun and educational weekend project.
